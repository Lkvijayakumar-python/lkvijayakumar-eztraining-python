DAY 6::
ADJACENCY:
connection should be there
PATH:-
there should be a root (or) path

types of graphs::-
1)undirected graph 
2)directed graph
3)weighted graph

## REPRESENTATION OF GRAPHS ##
1) list of edges
2) adjacency list
3)adjacency matrix

(BFS-breadth first search)
** In BFS visit a vertex and visit all the  adjacent vertexes
** whereas in DFS after visiting a vertex select one adj vertex and explore it completely and move on with other

### DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM ###
It comes under greedy method where sol for the given problem will figured out stage by stage 
# Dijkstra algorithm helps u to findout shortest path or distances from one vertex to all the other vertices

## DRAWBACKS ##
If weight of any edge is a negative number distance wont work for that
